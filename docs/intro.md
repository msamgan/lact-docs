# What is Lact?

**Lact** is a powerful Laravel package designed to simplify the integration between JavaScript front-end applications
and Laravel back-end systems. By providing an intuitive way to access Laravel controller methods directly from the
front-end, it eliminates the need for complex routing and API management. Lact allows developers to seamlessly call
back-end logic in their front-end code, enhancing efficiency and reducing development time.

It promotes clean code architecture by ensuring a clear separation between front-end and back-end, improving the
maintainability of large-scale applications. Whether you're building dynamic web apps or complex systems, **Lact**
streamlines the process for smooth, responsive interfaces.

## Why Use Lact?

- Skip writing repetitive routes for data fetching.
- Enjoy a seamless developer experience between front-end and back-end. 
- Improve productivity by building full-stack Laravel apps with lighting speed. 
- Maintain strict backend control while offering frontend flexibility.

## Who is it For?

- Laravel developers building modern frontends (React, Vue, etc.)
- Full-stack devs who want to skip routes boilerplate
- Teams wanting faster iteration without compromising backend control

## Project Status & Stability

Though Lact is currently in ``beta`` but actively maintained and ```stable for production use```.
Contributions and feedback are welcome to help grow the ecosystem.

## What you'll need

- [Node.js version 18.0](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or above: When installing Node.js, youâ€™re recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.
- The route function from [ziggy](https://github.com/tighten/ziggy) is a dependency. Though it comes by default installed with inertia setup, please make sure that it's installed.
- Since the package is using ziggy, we rely on ```route name```, please make sure the routes you need translation in action shave a name.
